I'm excited to share that I successfully passed my Ph.D. general examination! 

The general exam is a major milestone in the Ph.D. program at the University of Washington, where I presented my research progress and future plans to my committee. It was a great opportunity to synthesize my work on autonomous guidance, navigation, and control, particularly focusing on trajectory planning under line-of-sight constraints and perception-in-the-loop planning.

You can view the slides from my presentation [here](/general-exam-slides/).

Looking forward to continuing my research and moving forward with my dissertation work!
