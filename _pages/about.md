# Graduate Research in <span style='color: #F29559;'>Autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control</span>


I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics & Astronautics Department at the University of Washington, working with the [Autonomous Controls Laboratory](https://uwacl.com/) under Prof. Beh&#231;et A&#231;&#305;kme&#351;e and with the [Control and Trustworthy Robotics Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/ctrl/index.html) under Prof. Karen Leung.
My research focuses on the developing reliable and real-time capable Perception and Guidance methods for autonomous systems, and their practical applications in real-world systems.  To take full advantage of these algorithms, I also designed custom full-stack quadrotor controllers and hardware. This includes:

- Convex Optimization (Convex Approximation Methods)
- Real-Time Trajectory Optimization (Sequential Convex Programming)
- Perception-in-the-Loop Planning (Active Navigation)
- Primary Applications:
  - Aeronautics: Multirotors
  - Spaceflight: Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), Relative Orbital Maneuvers

Academically, I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied Physics (2021), and am the recipient of both the NASA NSTGRO and Washington Space Grant fellowships for graduate research. Professionally, I have worked as a Research Scientist Intern at Amazon Prime Air, a Research Intern at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, a Visiting Technologist at NASA Johnson Space Center, and an intern at the Autonomy and Technology Research Center at the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).
