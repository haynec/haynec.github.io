# Graduate Research in <span style='color: #3BB2E2;'>Autonomous Controls</span>


I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics & Astronautics Department at the University of Washington, working with the Autonomous Controls Laboratory under Prof. Beh&#231;et A&#231;&#305;kme&#351;e and with the Control and Trustworthy Robotics Laboratory (CTRL) under Prof. Karen Leung.
My research focuses on the developing reliable and real-time capable Perception and Guidance methods for autonomous systems, and their practical applications in real-world systems.  To take full advantage of these algorthims I also designed custom full-stack quadrotor controllers and hardware. This includes:

- Convex Optimization (Convex Approximation Methods)
- Real-Time Trajectory Optimization (Sequential Convex Programming)
- Perception-In-The-Loop Planning (Active Navigation)
- Primary Applications:
  - Aeronautics: Multirotors
  - Spaceflight: Landing Vehicles, Powered Descent Guidance, Relative Orbital Maneuvers

Academically, I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied Physics (2021), and am the recipient of both the NASA NSTGRO and Washington Space Grant fellowships for graduate research. Professionally, I have been a Visiting Technologist working at the NASA Johnson Space Center, as well as an internship at the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).
