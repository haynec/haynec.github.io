I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics & Astronautics Department at the University of Washington, working with the Autonomous Controls Laboratory under Prof. Beh&#231;et A&#231;&#305;kme&#351;e and with the Control and Trustworthy Robotics Laboratory (CTRL) under Prof. Karen Leung.
My research focuses on developing . This includes:

- Convex Optimization (Convex Approximation Methods)
- Real-Time Trajectory Optimization (Sequential Convex Programming)
- Perception-In-The-Loop Planning (Active Navigation)
- Primary Applications:
  - Spaceflight: Landing Vehicles, Powered Descent Guidance, Relative Orbital Maneuvers
  - Aeronautics: Multirotors

Academically, I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied Physics (2021), and am the recipient of both the NASA NSTGRO and Washington Space Grant fellowships for graduate research. Professionally, I have been a Visiting Technologist working at the NASA Johnson Space Center, as well as an internship at the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).
